# Pull Request Commenter Task

**Version:** 0.1

Pull Request Commenter Task posts a comment on a GitHub pull request summarizing the status of a pipeline execution. It deletes any previous comments made by the pipeline and posts a new one unless the pipeline was successful, in which case it skips commenting. The comment includes a summary of the pipeline run status, links to build logs, and instructions for re-running tests or retrieving artifacts using ORAS.
